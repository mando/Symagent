libsymbiot is a collection of C++ routines and objects that allow stand-alone
agents to be written that can communicate with the Symbiot Threat Profiler. 

libsymbiot relies on the Borrowed Time Core C++ library which is distributable
under the same terms as libsymbiot: The GNU Lesser Public License. Also 
required is the Borrowed Time SSL library, which simplifiles the communication,
authentication and key management used by libsymbiot.
