How to build and install the AgentSDK
=====================================

A shell script, named Build.sh, is generated within:

    PATH-TO/opensims/agent

This script automates the configure/compile/install process for
libsymbiot and the following agents and plugins:

    symagent
    symplugin-effector
    symplugin-log-watcher
    symplugin-mac-lookup
    symplugin-network
    symplugin-nmap
    symplugin-processes
    symplugin-snort-log
    symplugin-tester

The script contains some interesting variables at the top to govern
portions of the installation process.  They are:

    LIB_INSTALL_DIR             The base directory for the installed
                                libsymbiot files.  The shared library will
                                be installed into DIR/lib and the header
                                files will be installed into DIR/include.

    AGENT_INSTALL_DIR           The base directory for the installed agent
                                binary applications.  The actual directory
                                is DIR/bin.

    CONF_DIR                    The base directory that will contain agent
                                configuration files.

    LOG_DIR                     The base directory that will contain agent
                                log files.

    SERVERNAME                  The network name or IP address of the SIMS
                                appliance/server.

    INSTALL_STARTUP_SCRIPTS     May be either 1 or 0.  If 1, the script
                                calls 'make install-startup-script' within
                                the agent projects in order to install
                                either a Linux- or Gentoo-compatible
                                script into the system startup directory.
                                This install requires that the system
                                startup directory already exist.

To change any of the above variables, simply edit the Build.sh file.
[ NB: Sure, once the Ant scripts have generated it. ]

Note that, in general, libsymbiot must be built and installed before
any of the agents can be configured.  The reason for this lies with
library search directories in place during the compilation stage --
basically, we have to build against the library's final location.

Executing the script without modifying any of the controlling
variables will result in the following items new items:

    /usr/local/lib/
        libsymbiot.la
        libsymbiot.so -> libsymbiot.so.0.1.0
        libsymbiot.so.1 -> libsymbiot.so.0.1.0
        libsymbiot.so.0.1.0

    /usr/local/include/
        symlib-api.h
        symlib-defs.h
        symlib-exception.h
        symlib-message.h
        symlib-mutex.h
        symlib-task-queue.h
        symlib-tasks.h

    /usr/local/bin/
        symagent
        symagent-plugins

    /etc/init.d/
        symagent

    /var/log/opensims/
        symagent_error_log.txt      <-- created only when needed
        symagent_message_log.txt    <-- created only when needed


NOTE: The startup scripts installed for Linux are not automatically
setup to execute on system restart.  On most Linux systems, use the
chkconfig(8) utility to activate these scripts for the boot process.
Because they all require an active network, be sure to make them
startup relatively late.  For local agents, it is probably best to
have them startup after the application server (e.g. Tomcat) starts.


How to debug the AgentSDK
=========================

Start the agent executable directly (not as a service) with the
special command-line option:

	/usr/local/bin/symagent --enable-comm-logging start

That's it, by tailing the error and message log files, you should now
be able to see the agent talking to the server.
